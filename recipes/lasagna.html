        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is tender. Drain any excess fat.</li> 
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with 4 lasagna noodles, followed by one-third of the cheese mixture, and one-third of the remaining meat sauce. Repeat layers twice, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly. Let it cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
